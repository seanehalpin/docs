        <p class="c-work__text">Shape, at its core, is a library of all the email components in use at Help&nbsp;Scout. It was designed to speed up marketers lives, give them flexibility with the types of emails they could create, while at the same time imposing a structure that adhered to the companies brand guidelines. It was created in relation to three core issues:</p>
        <h3 class="c-work__sub-title">1. Scalability</h3>
        <p class="c-work__text">Lacking a single source of truth, multiple users were adding conflicting email templates, resulting in duplication and an overall hinderince to the scalabilty of the system.</p>
        <h3 class="c-work__sub-title">2. Responsiblity</h3>
        <p class="c-work__text">It became more and more difficult to track where changes and edits were taking place in the files, meaning that template edits could take place without oversight, inevitability resulting in broken emails.</p>
        <h3 class="c-work__sub-title">3. Maintainence</h3>
        <p class="c-work__text">Ensuring the emails were up to the latest brand guidelines had become a really tedious task, and with hundreds of files to update, a system to role out code changes and enhancements was sorely needed.</p>

        <h2 class="c-work__title c-work__title--large-top">In step Shape.</h2>
        <p class="c-work__text">I’ve never been a fan of the typical email builder. They tend to be either barebones or throw every possible feature combination at you. We didn’t need the kitchen sink. We needed something that would allow emails to be created quickly and effectively.</p>
        <p class="c-work__text">With those ideas in mind, I decided that this builder would be slightly different, putting the overall “shape” (get it?!… ahem) of the email front and centre. Edits would be made directly to what’s being produced, and menus would be contextual to the action being performed.</p>
